ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

## ðŸ‘¶ How it Started: Early Years (2013 - 2016)

ðŸ”¸ I began programming with Java in 2013 when I was just 12 years old.

ðŸ”¸ Less than a year later, I had grasped the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in the Eclipse environment.

ðŸ”¸ In 2014, I created basic interface designs using NetBeans and soon after, I worked with Canvas, Graphics, and JFrame libraries in Java.

ðŸ”¸ I also learned how to work with data tools like JSON and MySQL.

## ðŸ§‘ High School Years: A Shift Towards Game Development (2016 - 2019)
ðŸ”¸ In 2016, I discovered Unity, realizing my childhood dream of game development. I had to choose between C# and JavaScript for game programming, and I chose C#, using Visual Studio and Unity together.

ðŸ”¸ I worked on numerous game projects, most of which remained unfinished, but my first completed minigame came in 2019.

ðŸ”¸ Along the way, I gained a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

## ðŸ§” University Life: Teamwork and Technical Expansion (2021 - Present)
ðŸ”¸ At 20, in 2021, I joined my university's game development community and participated in my first teamwork experience at 48-hour game jams.

ðŸ”¸ As an Applied Physics student, I also learned Fortran and Python in my university courses. Python impressed me due to its wide array of applications and ease of use.

ðŸ”¸ My focus shifted to improving my data science skills, working with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Matplotlib, and more.

## ðŸ’¼ Internship Experience: Enhancing Communication Systems
During my internship, I developed and optimized communication systems between vehicles and servers, working on both front-end and back-end architectures. Key achievements included:

ðŸ”¸ Communication Architecture: Developed the front-end and back-end architecture for communication between vehicles and servers.

ðŸ”¸ Optimization: Enhanced communication protocols to improve efficiency and reduce latency.

ðŸ”¸ Data Management: Managed data flow and implemented effective strategies across platforms.

ðŸ”¸ Multi-threading: Integrated multi-threading tasks in the .NET Framework to improve system performance.

ðŸ”¸ Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensured seamless communication systems across both mobile and desktop platforms.

ðŸ”¸ Testing: Conducted rigorous testing to guarantee compatibility and efficiency in both environments.
